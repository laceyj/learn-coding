# Day 1: 1/9/2020
 Time spent: about 4 hours

<b>Tasks completed:</b>
- research: listened to a few podcasts, internet search on different dev careers and languages, reading ebooks
- signed up for GitHub, created this repository
- Bought $600 worth of Udemy courses for only $30
- Worked on some the Learn Python 2 course on https://www.codecademy.com/ (15% complete)
- installed Anaconda and PyCharm CE (although not sure what to do with either one yet :))
- attempted a warm up on CodingBat Python; it didn't go great as I'm only 2 hours into Python but the solution did make sense

<b>My background:</b> BBA in Management of Information Systems, which means I took a few programming classes in college but not many. I took C++, VisualBasic, and a class on SQL. Also have some exposure to HTML, CSS, and PHP. Most of these I haven't used in years but still retain some concepts. Currently and recently working in a school teaching computer classes. I often tell my students that if they could begin coding now, it would give them a massive headstart into what could be an amazing career option for them one day. It occurred to me (as I am severely underpaid and looking for a career change) that I am a bit of a hypocrit if I'm not also willing to work hard on coding. I have messed with JavaScript a bit during class while coding with my students but have no experience in Python. 

<b>My goals:</b> At the least, learn Python and learn SQL enough to feel comfortable with it on my resume. I feel very, very interested in back end development as well as full stack development and feel like it could really be my dream career. I am ready to dive in and get my hands dirty with code. Years ago, I used to say I'm not smart enough to be any good at coding. I based this on my struggles with my coding classes in college, but that was long ago and I'm a different person now. I'm eager to learn and work hard, and I feel much more confident that I can learn whatever I need to. The courses I purchased on Udemy will give me a great foundation towards either back end dev or full stack dev, and I think I'll feel more clearly drawn to one path or another after completing them. I have some ideas already for things I want to build with code so I think keeping that in mind will help me. I want to be able to apply the skills I learn to real life (most likely education based) scenarios so that my knowledge feels tangible rather than bookish. 

<b>I'm ready to dive in.</b>
