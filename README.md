# Day 1: 1/9/2020
 Time spent: about 4 hours

<b>Tasks completed:</b>
- research: listened to a few podcasts, internet search on different dev careers and languages, reading ebooks
- signed up for GitHub, created this repository
- Bought $600 worth of Udemy courses for only $30
- Worked on some the Learn Python 2 course on https://www.codecademy.com/ (15% complete)
- installed Anaconda and PyCharm CE (although not sure what to do with either one yet :))
- attempted a warm up on CodingBat Python; it didn't go great as I'm only 2 hours into Python but the solution did make sense

<b>My background:</b> BBA in Management of Information Systems, which means I took a few programming classes in college but not many. I took C++, VisualBasic, and a class on SQL. Also have some exposure to HTML, CSS, and PHP. Most of these I haven't used in years but still retain some concepts. Currently and recently working in a school teaching computer classes. I often tell my students that if they could begin coding now, it would give them a massive headstart into what could be an amazing career option for them one day. It occurred to me (as I am severely underpaid and looking for a career change) that I am a bit of a hypocrit if I'm not also willing to work hard on coding. I have messed with JavaScript a bit during class while coding with my students but have no experience in Python. 

<b>My goals:</b> At the least, learn Python and learn SQL enough to feel comfortable with it on my resume. I feel very, very interested in back end development as well as full stack development and feel like it could really be my dream career. I am ready to dive in and get my hands dirty with code. Years ago, I used to say I'm not smart enough to be any good at coding. I based this on my struggles with my coding classes in college, but that was long ago and I'm a different person now. I'm eager to learn and work hard, and I feel much more confident that I can learn whatever I need to. The courses I purchased on Udemy will give me a great foundation towards either back end dev or full stack dev, and I think I'll feel more clearly drawn to one path or another after completing them. I have some ideas already for things I want to build with code so I think keeping that in mind will help me. I want to be able to apply the skills I learn to real life (most likely education based) scenarios so that my knowledge feels tangible rather than bookish. 

<b>I'm ready to dive in.</b>


# DAY 26: 2/4/2020
Time spent: ~40-45 hours

I decided that I wanted to spend as much time as possible working on studying and learning and actual code and tools rather than daily journaling of my experiences. I do want to check in after big milestones here, but I don't want to not do something just because I don't have the time to journal about it later. 

<b>Recent tasks completed:</b>
- finished my first Udemy course! (The Ultimate MySQL Bootcamp by Colt Steele
- installed Node, Ruby, MySQL, and also Express and EJS on my projects
- built my first (basic) web app at the end of the course
- managed to spend 2-3 every day after work on learning to code! (only missed 2 days due to illness but made up the time)

<b>Thoughts on how it's going:</b>
I am glad I started with the MySQL course since I have had some experience with SQL and relational databases. Things clicked into place pretty quickly especially early on, which gave me the boost of confidence I needed. Later in the course things got a bit trickier but I always persisted and it was good to see that I was able to overcome challenges. I know I have sooo many things to learn and additional challenges to tackle but this gave me a little taste of what I can accomplish with persistence and determination. 

I am getting more comfortable with Command Line, which is new to me but I am really enjoying it. Using VS Code is becoming more natural and I know it will only get easier. It seems like a great tool so far. Installing packages like Node and Express was something I didn't think I'd be doing in the MySQL course but I'm glad we did because it left me hungry for more web development knowledge.

My plan is to do another Colt Steele course next - "The Web Developer Bootcamp". It is pretty extensive so I'm hoping by the end I will feel a little more comfortable trudging through some very simple projects on my own. I haven't decided if I want to do the Swift/iOS Dev course I bought after that or if I want to do the Python course next.

My first project I want to build will be a simple inventory web app for managing a personal library. I am super excited about it as I want a solution for my own small library!

I also have learning more about Git on my list. I have some YouTube videos saved to watch and some documentation to read. I'm hoping the web dev course might address some of that too. 

If you need me, I'll be at my computer! (Or reading a book when I need some downtime.)

# DAY 32: 2/10/2020
Time Spent: ~55-60 hours

I'm enjoying The Web Development Bootcamp course I started a few days ago. I've already gone through the initial HTML and CSS sections and although I've been exposed to both in the past it's FINALLY clicking in a way it never has! This has been super encouraging. I'm figuring out that a big part of learning web development involves reading documentation and looking things up on MDN in addition to writing code and doing the courses I'm doing. I've done some reading on git and GitHub and am anxious to use it once I get to the Javascript section of my current course. 

Everything I'm learning has rekindled this love of technology I have, and I find myself wanting to tinker with things more than I have been lately. I wrote a simple bash script to launch all of my development/productivity apps I'm using so that when I get home from work I can just run the executable file and it will <b><em>magically</b></em> launch them for me. It was super easy and fast and works like a charm!

I am not sure why I waited to do this but I offically started the #100DaysofCode challenge on Twitter 3 days ago and even though I am really 32 days in I decided to start from Day 1. I don't think it will be difficult at all to write a quick tweet logging my progress for the day and interacting with a couple of other #100DaysofCode(rs). I knew from the beginning that I didn't want to write longform journal entries about my daily progress because I didn't want it to slow me down...but I think it will be good to do the simple tweets and then in 100 days look back on my progress. I am still averaging 2 1/2-3 hours a day learning and coding and when I can I try to do extra time. I start a second job soon so I will literally only have one hour a day of "extra" time to learn/code (unless I get less than 7 hours of sleep a night but I don't want to burn out). It's a temporary job I do for extra money in the spring months so it won't last forever but it will slow me down just a bit. I will try to make sure the one hour I do have is very productive when I get to that point. 

Now that I've finished the HTML and CSS sections, Bootstrap is next! I am excited about learning some frameworks and diving in deep to Javascript. Time to tighten my bootstraps. Sorry. :/
